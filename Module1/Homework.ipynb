### Question 1: [Index] S&P 500 Stocks Added to the Index
Which year had the highest number of additions?

Using the list of S&P 500 companies from [Wikipedia's S&P 500 companies page](https://https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_S%26P_500_companies), download the data including the year each company was added to the index.

Create a DataFrame with company tickers, names, and the year they were added.
Extract the year from the addition date and calculate the number of stocks added each year.
Which year had the highest number of additions (1957 doesn't count, as it was the year when the S&P 500 index was founded)? Write down this year as your answer (the most recent one, if you have several records).
